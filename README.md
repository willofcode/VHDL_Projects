# VHDL Projects
VHDL component implementation of logic untis

# Lab 1:
- Implemented 4-1 Multiplexer
- Implemented 2-1 Multiplexer and Adder for 1-Bit ALU
- Implemented 8-Bit ALU

# Lab 2:
- Implemented ALU logic for Optimized division
- Implemented DivRegister logic for Division
- Implemented Control logic for Division
- Implemented Division logic using ALU, DivRegister, and Control for Optimized Division

# Lab 4:
- Implemented Instruction decoder for Mips Processor
- Implemented ALU Control to communicate with Decoder
- Implemented Test Module that connects Instruction decoder and ALU control to work sychronously

# Lab 5:
- Implemented Register module for reading 8-byte instruction address
- Implemented ROM module which performs read-only, short for read-only memory
- Implemented RAM module which is short for Random Access Memory, updating RAM memory
